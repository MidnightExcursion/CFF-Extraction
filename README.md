# ComptonFormFactorExtractionWithANN
An ANN-approach to extracting what's called the "Compton Form Factors" that are important in the "Proton Spin Crisis."

# A Physics Introduction

What's called the "Proton Spin Crisis" is a major problem in modern physics. The idea is roughly as follows:

The Proton is not a fundamental particle. Rather, it is composed of fundamental consitutents that interact in complex ways. Specifically, we know that its constituents are Quarks and Gluons. These are fundamental particles as described in the Quantum Field Theory called "Quantum Chromodynamics." In essence, the fundamental particles have properties -- like quantum spin -- that when they come together to form a composite object, we might expect those properties to "add" in a simple way.

The Proton, as we understand it, has a half-integer spin (1/2). The observation that the Proton's spin seems to not be the sum of its parts is the genesis of the tension. Those Quarks and Gluons contribute their spins to the overall net spin of the Proton in an unintuitive way. As a pop-science example, it's known that the Proton contains three valence Quarks: Two Ups and one Down Quark. Each of those three Quarks actually has half-integer spin. Naively, then, if spin "adds" (it doesn't in the way that 1 + 1 = 2 "adds"), then the spin of the Proton ought to be 3/2. It is not.

# The Objective of the Code

Well, I'm working on it.
